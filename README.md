## Project Description:
This project focuses on utilizing satellite imagery data to trace water bodies and estimate their pH values. Leveraging Google Earth Engine's code editor, the project employs a two-step process: calculating the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) followed by pH value estimation using Landsat 8 data.

## Team Members:
- Anshul Kunwar
- Aditya
- Modini Bhardwaj

## Supervisor:
- Shaveta Jain

## Methodology:
1. **NDWI Computation**: NDWI is computed to identify water bodies based on satellite imagery.
2. **pH Value Estimation**: Utilizing Landsat 8 data, pH values of the identified water bodies are estimated.
3. **Web Application Deployment**: The project is deployed as a user-friendly web application for easy access and visualization of results.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Google Earth Engine code to calculate NDWI and estimate pH values.
3. Follow deployment instructions to host the web application and interactively trace water bodies and explore pH values.
